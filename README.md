Certainly! Here's an example of an interactive code snippet that you can include in your GitHub README for a big data project focused on fake news detection:

```python
# Fake News Detection with Big Data

This project aims to detect fake news using big data techniques. The code provided here demonstrates the basic workflow for training and evaluating a fake news detection model using a large dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset:

- [Dataset 1](https://example.com/dataset1.zip)
- [Dataset 2](https://example.com/dataset2.zip)

4. Extract the dataset files into the `data` directory.

## Training the Model

To train the fake news detection model, run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_path ./data --model_path ./models/model.pkl
```

This command will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it to the specified `model_path`.

## Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --data_path ./data --model_path ./models/model.pkl
```

This will load the trained model from the `model_path`, evaluate it on the test data, and display evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
